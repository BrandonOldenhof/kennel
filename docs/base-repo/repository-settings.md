# Repository settings

## Branch model & permissions

We're using the git flow branch model. That means the branch naming should follow the rules defined in the [Git branch model](https://roxmedia.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/11010102/Git+branch+model). This can be configured under "Repository settings" > "Branching model".

The branch permissions can also be found in the [Git branch model](https://roxmedia.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/11010102/Git+branch+model) document and configured under "Repository settings" > "Branch permissions".
